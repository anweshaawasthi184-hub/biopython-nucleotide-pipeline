<h1><b>Biopython Nucleotide Pipeline</h1><br>
This project provides a complete pipeline for analyzing nucleotide sequences using Biopython. It automates common bioinformatics tasks, including:<br>
ðŸ”¹ Fetching nucleotide sequences directly from the NCBI database using an accession ID.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Basic sequence analysis: complement, reverse complement, transcription (DNA â†’ RNA), translation (RNA â†’ protein).<br>
ðŸ”¹ GC content calculation for genomic composition analysis.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Pairwise sequence alignment (both global and local) using Biopythonâ€™s PairwiseAligner.<br>
ðŸ”¹ BLASTn search against the NCBI nucleotide (nt) database to find homologous sequences.<br>
This pipeline is useful for students, researchers, and beginners in bioinformatics who want a step-by-step introduction to working with nucleotide sequences using Python.<br>
